NOTES:
The logical OR operator || checks two values and returns a boolean. If one or both values are truthy, it returns true. If both values are falsy, it returns false.
true || false; //true
10 >5 || 10 > 20 //true
false || false; //false
10 > 100 || 10 >20; //false

Logical Operators = In JavaScript, values evaluate to true or false when evaluated as Booleans.

Comparison Operators
Values that evaluate to true are known as truthy
Values that evaluate to false are known as falsy
Falsy values include false, 0, empty strings, null undefined, and NaN. All other values are truthy.

Comparison operators are used to comparing two values and return true or false depending on the validity of the comparison:

=== strict equal
!== strict not equal
> greater than
>= greater than or equal
< less than
<= less than or equal

Ternary Operator
let price = 10.5;
let day = "Monday";

day === "Monday" ? price -= 1.5 : price += 1.5;
The ternary operator allows for a compact syntax in the case of binary (choosing between two choices) decisions. 
It accepts a condition followed by a ? operator, and then two expressions separated by a :. 
If the condition evaluates to truthy, the first expression is executed, otherwise, the second expression is executed.

&& used to check if both statements are true. 
true && true        // returns true
true && false       // returns false
